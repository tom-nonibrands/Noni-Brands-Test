## INSTRUCTIONS

### PART 1: CSS

Using CSS properties alone, recreate the button
on the page. Spend approximately 20 minutes on it,
we don't expect it to be a perfect match.

It's open book, feel free to hit Google.

### PART 2: Javascript

When clicking on your newly styled button, connect
to an API using an GET ajax request. Spend
approximately 25 minutes on it.

API Endpoint: https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=9e56665dd12747d699700625112fe619

Display the new articles you get from the API in a visually appealing way.
